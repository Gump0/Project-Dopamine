  message: "Well, in terms of enjoyment, you clearly passed with flying colours,
    in terms of your actual grade you have failed by a wide margin. You\u2019ve failed
    so badly that you\u2019ve somehow managed to cause your entire class to fail
    just by association, causing you to be the ire of your entire program until the
    end of time. Womp Womp."
